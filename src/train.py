# -train_batches holds training data as tensors.
# -dev_batches holds dev data as tensors, for estimating model quality
# by its performance (bleu score) on the dev set.
# -references used for calculating dev set bleu score.
# -idx_to_trg_word holds dictionary that maps decoder predictions
# (which are indices in a vocabulary) to their corresponding words,
# for use during prediction of dev set.
# -total_epochs is number of epochs to train the model across ALL sessions,
# not just this training session (e.g., if load a model to continue training
# from, which has already trained 5 epochs, and total_epochs = 10,
# then this session will only train for 5 more).
# -checkpoint_path denotes location where will store:
#   -checkpoints,
#   -epoch stats for each checkpoint, and
#   -text files holding greedy predictions of each checkpoint.
#   -if from_scratch==False, then checkpoint_path holds path to checkpoint to load.
# -save denotes whether or not to save checkpoints (e.g., do not save
# when running particular unit tests).

# each checkpoint is on the order of ~1 GB, and most of them are not contenders
# (e.g., in early epochs, when weights not yet optimized), so only ever store
# the most recent model, e.g., so can resume training at a later time,
# and the best model found so far, so upon termination
# (by meeting early-stopping threshold or otherwise),
# can return the best model for later predicting the test set.
# store with model_data how many epochs it has been trained for.
# if zero, then print "training from scratch"

# train a model on preprocessed data inside checkpoint path, of hyperparameters inside checkpoint path.
